# Workshop: Project planning

## In pairs 

### Step 1: Play the game
Take a look, for example, at this simple implementation of the classic arcade game [Pong](https://facapplicants.github.io/planning/pong.html).

### Step 2: Break it into parts
Make a list of all the elements and interactions required to recreate what you see in your browser window.

### Step 3: Put the list into a sequential order
Imagine you are building it from scratch. Put your list of elements and interactions into a sensible task list from start to finish. Think carefully about the sequence.

## As a group

### Step 4: Create a shared list
Decide collectively in what order we are going to build the different parts of the game.

#### Roles
- **Scribe**: Document our decisions and agreed-upon sequence.
- **Facilitator**: Guides the discussion, ensuring everyone's ideas are heard and keeping us focused.
